                      introduction of compiler design
  
                             compiler_design

Compiler-its actually compiler languge preprocessor.A compiler is a program thatheads a program written in one larguge called source language and translate it into an equivalent program in another language called the target language program.                  (source program)-->compiler-->(target program)
                                        |                               (error detection)    
in acompiler we use source program input and we get a output target program.in
There is any error detection compiler will be detect and we can see in display.
In same like compiler working computer anther language system is inter preter.
                (source program)-->interpreter-->(output)
                                       |
                                (error detection)                               
                               

interpreter-Translate one statement at time _compiler_Translate whole program into machinc code.  
2.takes less amount of time to analyze the code but over all exeution is slower. takes alrge amount of time to analyze the code but over all excution is faster.3. no intermediate abject code is generated and hence are memory efficent.
   Generte intermediate code and hence requires more memory.
4. Debugging is easy_dubugging is harder
eg: pythan,ruby,c,c++.

Language processing system

Source program 
1.Preprocessor
modified source program
2.Compiler
target assembly program
3.Assembler
relocatable machinc wote
4.Linker/loader-libary files relocatable object file
target machine code.

How will work langnage processing system

1.In preprocessor file inclusion #include and macro expansion #define.

*Compiler will output produce assembly program. source program machine program between the two assembly program.(not in d,s & is).compiler genrate pass to assembler.

2.Assembler means
It depends up on computer platform,it corvent relocatable machne code.

3.Linker/Loader
When assemble create a machine code it passaway.linker/loater while doing it will link all the required files in linker/loader. traget machine code work like
this.
