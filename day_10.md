write a summary about inteoduction of compiler design-geeks Cross Compiler that runs on a machin A and produces a code for another machine B It is capable of creating code for a pltform other than the one on which the compiler is runing.Source-to-source Compiler or transcompiler or transpiler isa compiler that translates source code written in one programming language into the source code of another programming languag.
Language processing systems using Compiler 
We know a computer is a logical assembly of Software and Hrdware. The hardware knows a language, that is hard for us to grasp, consequently, we tend to write programs in a high-level language, that is much less complicated for us to comprehend and maintain in thoughts. Now, these programs go through a series of transformations so that they can readily be used by machines. This is where language procedure systems come in handy. 
High-Level Language – If a program contains #define or #include directives such as #include or #deine it is called HLL. They are closer to huans but far from machines. These (#) tags are called preprocessor directives. They direct the pre-processor about what to do.Pre-Processor – The pre-processor removes all the #include directives by including the files called file inclusion and all the #define directives using macro expansion. It performs file inclusion, augmentation, macro-processing, etc.
    Assembly Language – It’s neither in binary form nor high level. It is an intermediate state that is a combination of machine instructions and some other useful data needed for execution.Assembler – For every platform (Hardware + OS) we will have an assembler. They are not universal since for each platform we have one. The output of the assembler is called an object file. Its translates assembly language to machine code
Interpreter – An interpreter converts high-level language into low-level machine language, just like a compiler. But they are different in the way they readthe input. The Compiler in one go reads the inputs, does the processing, and executes the source code whereas the interpreter does the same line by line. Compiler scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code whereas an interpreter translates the program one statement at a time. Interpreted programs are usually slower with respect to compiled ones. Reloatable Machine Code  It can be loaded at any point and can be run. Theaddres wihin the program will be in such a way that it will cooperate with the program movement.
Loader/Linker – It converts the relocatable code into absolute code and tries torun the program resulting in a running program or an error message (or sometimesboth can happen). Linker loads a variety of object files into a single file to make it executable. Then loader loads it in memory and executes it.
Phases of a Compiler  
There are two major phases of compilation, which in turn have many parts. Each of them takes input from the output of the previous level and works in a coordinated way
